These two sequences show the maximum and minimum hit/miss ratio respectively
1) 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
2) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 ...

So, we can see that in order to increase the hit/miss ratio, we need a smaller set of different numbers,
and in order to reduce the hit/miss ratio, we need a larger set of different numbers
